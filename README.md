# Word embeddings of small, endangered languages

The skip-gram (neural network) model from word2vec build from scratch in Python in order to (1) understand how word embeddings are created and (2) to create custom word embeddings of small, endangered languages. This implementation is based on [Jake Tae](https://github.com/jaketae)'s blog post [Word2vec from Scratch](https://jaketae.github.io/study/word2vec/).

Additional information as well as the seminar paper will follow soon.
